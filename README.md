# IT-Helpdesk-Lab-Series
## Overview
Welcome to my Home Lab Series! In this series, I demonstrate how to use Active Directory from both a helpdesk and sysadmin perspective within a virtualized lab environment. These labs document a series of hands-on experiments focused on building, configuring, and troubleshooting Active Directory setups in a simulated IT setting.

Using VirtualBox as the virtualization platform, Iâ€™ve created a networked configuration of three virtual machines:

1. Windows Server 2022: Serves as the domain controller and the system administrator's primary workstation.
2. Windows 10 (Helpdesk): Represents a helpdesk environment equipped with tools like RSAT for Active Directory management.
3. Windows 10 (Local User): Simulates a local user for testing tasks such as password resets and troubleshooting.
   
## Purpose

This Lab series is designed to:

Highlight my expertise in managing and configuring Active Directory environments.
Demonstrate proficiency in performing helpdesk-level IT tasks, including troubleshooting and problem resolution.
Develop and document a foundational understanding of enterprise IT tools and workflows commonly employed in professional environments.
